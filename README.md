Resume Match :
Resume Match is an innovative system designed to revolutionize the traditional recruitment process by automating the evaluation of resumes against job descriptions.
Matching resumes with job descriptions is a significant challenge in modern recruitment. Manual evaluations are time-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. This project tackles these challenges by developing an NLP-based tool to automate the process. Built with robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this tool provides a detailed analysis of candidate compatibility through metrics such as:

Similarity scores
Keyword matches
Sentiment analysis
Experience calculations
The system employs advanced algorithms, including TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, and TextBlob, to evaluate resumes and extract meaningful insights.

Features:
Multi-format support: Process resumes in formats like PDF, DOCX, TXT, and CSV.
Detailed visual insights: Generate bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to visualize results.
User-friendly interface: Recruiters can easily upload resumes, input job descriptions, and view compatibility metrics.
Efficient and unbiased: Reduce processing time, enhance accuracy, and minimize biases in candidate selection.
By addressing inefficiencies in manual screening, Resume Match streamlines the recruitment process and empowers recruiters with actionable insights.
